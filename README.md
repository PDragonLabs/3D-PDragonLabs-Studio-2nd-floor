PDragonLabs Virtual Studio

Welcome to the PDragonLabs Virtual Studio, an interactive 3D audio-visual sandbox built with Three.js. This project transforms a web browser into a creative space where users can design their studio's ambiance, produce music with a multi-channel sampler, and interact with a dynamic 3D environment.

This application started as a simple 3D room and has evolved into a feature-rich production tool, demonstrating the power of WebGL for creating immersive experiences.
‚ú® Features

The studio is packed with a wide array of interactive features, giving users extensive creative control.
3D Environment & Interaction

    Full 3D Navigation: Explore the studio with intuitive orbit controls (pan, zoom, rotate).

    Draggable Furniture: Click and drag studio equipment (mixing desk, keyboard, speakers) to arrange the layout to your liking.

    Dynamic Lighting System:

        Independently control the brightness of the Main Room and the glass Recording Booth.

        An overhead Track Lighting rig provides realistic spotlights.

        Adjust the Art Brightness to make wall media glow for the perfect mood.

Visual Customization

    Multimedia Walls: Apply custom textures to the studio walls by uploading your own images (.jpg, .png) or video clips (.mp4).

    Image-Based Color Palettes: The application automatically analyzes uploaded images and generates a vibrant 5-color palette. Click a color to instantly theme the studio floor.

    Intuitive "Edit Walls" Mode: A dedicated mode for placing media prevents accidental changes and streamlines the design process.

Advanced Audio Production Suite

    Playlist & Positional Audio: Upload and play your own .mp3 tracks. The sound realistically emanates from a speaker in the 3D space.

    Microphone Recording: Record audio directly from your microphone. The system gracefully handles cases where a mic is unavailable.

    Dual-Source Sampling: Create audio clips from two different sources:

        The currently playing Main Track.

        Your Last Mic Recording.

    8-Pad Multi-Channel Sampler:

        Assign your created samples to an 8-pad sampler interface.

        Trigger multiple pads simultaneously to layer sounds.

        Each pad features independent Volume and Loop controls.

    Digital Wall Timer: A glowing red digital clock on the wall displays the precise playback time of the main track.

Polished User Interface

    Collapsible Panels: The main settings panel (visuals) and the entire audio suite can be hidden with toggle buttons, providing a clean, unobstructed view of the studio.

    Organized Layout: Controls are logically grouped into dedicated panels for recording, sampling, track playback, and visual settings.

üöÄ How to Use

    Explore: Use your mouse to drag, pan, and zoom to look around the studio.

    Customize the Look:

        Open the Settings panel (top-right).

        Upload an image or .mp4 file.

        Click the "Edit Walls" button, then click on a wall to apply your media.

        Use the generated Color Palette to change the floor color.

        Adjust the lighting sliders to set the mood.

    Make Music:

        Open the Audio panel (bottom-left).

        Upload an .mp3 to the main track player.

        As the track plays, use the Sample Editor to "Set Start" and "Set End" points, name your sample, and save it. It will be assigned to the next open pad.

        Use the Sample Pads in the Settings panel to play and loop your creations!

        Record your own audio using the Recording panel.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

    Three.js / WebGL: The core 3D rendering library.

    JavaScript (ES6 Modules): For all application logic, interaction, and audio processing.

    HTML5: Structure and UI elements.

    CSS3: Styling, layout, and animations for the UI panels.

This project was developed in collaboration with PDragonLabs.
